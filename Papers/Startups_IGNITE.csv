What makes it worse is that everyone’s skin is unique. A product that works wonders for one person can trigger breakouts for another. Yet, most of today’s grooming recommendations are generic, leaving people to waste money on trial and error, damaging their skin, and losing trust in the process.

On the other side, brands also face a challenge, reaching the right audience who genuinely needs their products. They spend heavily on marketing, but customers often feel misled when products don’t suit them.

This gap between consumer confusion and brand communication is the core problem GroomAI solves.

By combining AI-driven personalisation with skincare expertise, GroomAI helps individuals understand their skin type, concerns, and needs, and then recommends the right products tailored to them. No guesswork. No generic advice. Just smart, personalised guidance.

In short, GroomAI simplifies grooming decisions for people and makes product discovery more authentic, helping users look and feel their best while building trust for brands.","Skincare and grooming are overwhelming today. With endless products, contradictory advice, and generic “one-size-fits-all” suggestions, people are left confused, frustrated, and often spending money on products that don’t work for them.

The truth is simple: every skin is different. What clears one person’s acne might trigger another’s. Yet, the industry continues to push broad recommendations instead of truly personalised solutions. This trial-and-error not only wastes time and money but can also harm skin health and confidence.

At the same time, brands struggle to connect with the right audience. Their products often miss the mark because customers don’t know what suits them, leading to mistrust and wasted marketing spend.

GroomAI bridges this gap. Using AI, we analyse an individual’s skin type, lifestyle, and concerns to provide personalised grooming recommendations, replacing guesswork with clarity. Consumers get tailored solutions, while brands reach people who genuinely benefit from their products.

In essence, GroomAI removes confusion from skincare, builds trust between people and products, and makes grooming smarter, simpler, and more personal.","GroomAI offers a personalised, AI-driven approach to skincare and grooming. Instead of relying on generic advice or endless trial-and-error, our platform analyses an individual’s skin type, concerns, and lifestyle to generate tailored product recommendations.

The uniqueness lies in our three-phase model:

Awareness & Knowledge – We educate users with AI-powered insights about their skin and grooming needs, cutting through misinformation.

Personalised Recommendations – Our AI matches users with the right products based on their unique profile, ensuring accuracy and trust.

E-commerce Integration – A seamless platform, like a “Zomato for skincare,” where users can instantly discover, compare, and shop products curated for them.

Unlike traditional beauty platforms, GroomAI doesn’t just show what’s trending, it shows what’s right for you. By combining deep learning with dermatological knowledge, we transform grooming into a science-backed, personalised experience.

This creates a win-win: users save time, money, and frustration, while brands gain trust and reach the right audience more effectively.

In short, GroomAI is not just a skincare recommender; it’s a smart companion that makes grooming simpler, smarter, and truly personal.","GroomAI serves two core audiences:

Consumers (Primary Focus)
Young adults and professionals (16-35 years) who are conscious about their skin, grooming, and appearance but are overwhelmed by too many product choices. This includes people struggling with acne, oily/dry skin, sensitivity, or simply those who want to look their best without wasting money on trial-and-error.

These users are digital-first, shop online frequently, and value personalised recommendations over generic marketing. For them, GroomAI acts as a personal skincare advisor available anytime.

Brands & Retailers (Secondary Focus)
Skincare and grooming companies that want to reach the right customers. GroomAI helps them showcase products directly to people who need them, reducing wasted marketing spend and building consumer trust.

By targeting both ends of the ecosystem, GroomAI creates a two-sided value chain: users get personalised guidance, and brands get authentic, effective product placement.

Initially, our focus will be on urban Indian consumers, college students, young professionals, and early adopters who already engage with digital wellness solutions. As we grow, GroomAI can expand into global markets and partner with D2C grooming brands, making personalised skincare accessible worldwide.",0,NA,NA,"We are seeking an initial investment of ₹5-10 lakhs to build our MVP, onboard early users, and validate product-market fit.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMgHV7It0H0emz7XMvabe2yYway0ZeYQ/view?usp=sharing,Yes,https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_AD2JSlPVGijyDlBoOLW1Cnxadz25r9/view?usp=sharing,"Past Project – Skin Image Classifier (by Abhinandan)
As part of my AI learning journey, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies different skin conditions from images. The model achieved over 80% accuracy on a test dataset and gave me hands-on experience in computer vision, TensorFlow, and model deployment.

This project laid the foundation for GroomAI, where we’re now extending the concept from pure classification to personalised product recommendations using AI.","Most grooming and skincare companies assume customers want more choices, new products, trends, and recommendations. The truth is, customers are drowning in choices. What they want is clarity and confidence in what works for them.

We understand that grooming isn’t about following generic beauty trends. It’s about solving deeply personal problems: acne before a big interview, dryness that kills confidence, or finding products that won’t waste money or harm skin.

Where others focus on selling more products, GroomAI focuses on helping people make the right choice. That’s the gap we see: personalisation isn’t a “nice-to-have,” it’s the core need in modern grooming.

And unlike other platforms, we’re not just curating products, we’re combining AI + skin science + e-commerce into a single flow: learn your skin, get tailored advice, shop instantly.

That’s what we see, that others miss: grooming is not about “beauty marketing,” it’s about trust, personalisation, and simplicity.",NA

Households in Water-Stressed Areas (Primary): 35 million Indians lacking safe water access, particularly in states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra experiencing severe groundwater depletion. These customers pay ₹8-15/L for bottled water and face unreliable municipal supply.

Key Insight: Rural and peri-urban households spend 10-25% of income on water procurement. Our ₹2-4/L cost and ₹1.5-2.5L unit price offers 3-year ROI, making it economically viable.

Commercial & Institutional (Secondary): Schools, hospitals, hotels, and offices in water-scarce regions. They currently depend on expensive tanker water costing ₹50-100 per 1000L, with unreliable supply disrupting operations.

Government & NGOs (Tertiary): Municipalities implementing decentralized water solutions under Jal Jeevan Mission. NGOs serving remote communities where traditional infrastructure isn't feasible.

Our insight: in India, accounting systems won’t be replaced; they’re the system of record. Trust beats “AI magic.” Buyers want plain-English answers computed from the live books with a clickable path to ledger lines—no migrations, no warehouse, minimal data at rest. Founders value “safe to spend now” and “runway if we hire X”; CAs value auto-reconciliation, controlled posting, exception inboxes, and rollback. Success is measured by auto-match rate, time to close, and how quickly a founder gets a defensible answer during a meeting.

Utkarsh led tech (web app, real-time order routing, vendor dashboards, payments), while Manan ran ops (vendor acquisition, SLAs, support, reconciliations). In a few months we onboarded dozens of campus vendors, served 15,000+ students, and crossed ~₹8 lakh GMV. We ran delivery windows, standardised menus and pricing, and set up dispute resolution and payout workflows so vendors were paid on time. The project was eventually shut by the college administration, and we wound it down responsibly and helped vendors transition. The big lesson was stakeholder alignment: ship fast, but secure institutional buy-in, define guardrails, and measure impact weekly. That discipline around operations, compliance, and clear metrics directly shapes how we build Axlo today.","Finance teams in India will not replace Tally, Zoho, or QuickBooks. These are the system of record, so trust comes from answers that route back to ledger lines, not from a new dashboard or a data warehouse. Founders do not want “analytics.” They want an immediate, defensible answer to a plain-English cash question during a meeting.

The unit of value is a source-linked answer, computed from live books with deterministic math, not an AI guess. Privacy posture matters: default to real-time fetch and store only audit-ready metadata to reduce procurement friction.

Clean books unlock everything. Analytics without reconciliation is noise, so the product must close the loop: automated reconciliation, controlled posting, rollback, and an exception inbox.

India-specific realities shape the design: GST/TDS, Razorpay or PhonePe settlement splits, T+N delays, fees, refunds, and payroll breakups create multi-way matches that generic tools miss.

We measure success by outcomes finance teams feel: auto-match rate, time-to-answer, time-to-close, exceptions under 2 percent, and zero duplicate postings. That is the bar for trust.","What milestones do you expect before a follow-on check, and what is a typical check size and timing?"

Today, schools rely on unreliable transport solutions and apps that offer poor UX and limited features. Standard operating procedures still depend on paper, lacking digitisation and convenience, which wastes time and reduces trust in the system, leaving parents frustrated and schools overwhelmed.","Our solution is StepConnect — a unified, parent-first school transport platform. Unlike the fragmented, unreliable apps schools currently use, StepConnect brings everything into a single, trusted system.

For parents, we provide live bus tracking with intelligent alerts. Even when buses go offline, our system caches updates and delivers them once connectivity returns — ensuring parents are never left guessing. The interface is designed to be intuitive and stress-free, giving parents clear ETAs and peace of mind.

For schools, we remove the burden of handling transport complaints by routing support directly through us. This ensures smoother operations, happier parents, and no additional tech overhead.

On the backend, StepConnect is built with scalability and reliability in mind, architected to handle thousands of buses and schools seamlessly. This gives us the foundation to become the category-defining platform for school transport in India, a ₹7,200 crore market with no established leader.

In short, we’re not just building another tracking app — we’re creating the go-to platform that unifies school transport for parents and schools alike, making the experience reliable, simple, and stress-free.","Our primary customers are luxury schools, with parents as the ultimate beneficiaries. Schools in India face daily pressure from anxious parents about bus delays, missed pick-ups, or safety concerns. Today, they juggle multiple disconnected apps or rely on manual communication, which creates frustration, inefficiency, and constant complaints.

Our insight is that schools don’t just want “a GPS app” — they want a single, reliable platform that reduces parent stress and takes transport complaints easy to handle. Parents, on the other hand, want simplicity and trust. They don’t want to download three different apps or chase the transport manager for updates; they want clear, reliable alerts about their child’s bus, even when connectivity is patchy.

This dual perspective is our edge. By positioning StepConnect as a parent-first solution delivered through schools, we make adoption seamless. Schools look better to parents without additional work, while parents get a unified, dependable experience.

Our unique understanding is that the real buyer is the school, but the real user is the parent — and unless both are satisfied, adoption fails. StepConnect bridges that gap, turning a daily pain point into a smooth, trusted experience for everyone.",0,NA,NA,INR 80 Lakhs,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gd30kfW7HBjchTt-WpyUH_qIsaolXFxW?usp=sharing,Yes,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gd30kfW7HBjchTt-WpyUH_qIsaolXFxW?usp=sharing,"Our tech co-founder built a bus booking platform from scratch, showcasing both technical depth and execution ability.

It enabled users to search, book, and manage bus tickets seamlessly, with a clean user interface. The project demonstrated end-to-end ownership—from backend architecture and DevOps to deployment—proving our ability to design, build, and scale real-world transport solutions.","Most companies treat school transport as a tech add-on—a GPS tracker, a parent app, or a fleet tool. What they miss is that transport is an emotional problem, not just a logistical one. Parents don’t care about raw location data; they care about peace of mind. Schools don’t want another dashboard; they want fewer complaints. Our insight is that unless both sides win—parents feeling reassured and schools feeling less burdened—adoption will fail. StepConnect is built around this balance: a parent-first experience delivered via schools, with reliability even in patchy networks, where others’ apps usually break.","Regarding Mentorship, In what ways does PIEDS stay involved beyond the competition?

Our solution provides real-time river flow data, predictive flood forecasts, and instant alerts, ensuring proactive disaster management. By doing so, we bridge the critical gap between raw data and actionable insights, helping communities, farmers, and governments prepare in advance and minimize flood impacts.","ClimMaTech offers an integrated IoT and AI-powered flood monitoring and forecasting solution designed for vulnerable river basins and agricultural regions. Unlike traditional systems that only record water levels, our solution combines rugged low-cost IoT devices with an AI-based predictive model to provide both real-time data and advance flood forecasts.

Our hardware includes river depth and flow monitoring sensors, rainfall and weather stations, and early warning sirens—all connected to a secure cloud-based dashboard accessible through web and mobile. The system continuously measures environmental parameters and applies deep learning models trained on hydrological and meteorological data to detect anomalies and predict flood events.

The uniqueness lies in three aspects:

Affordability and scalability – modular devices that can be deployed even in remote terrains at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems.

Proactive intelligence – shifting from reactive alerts to predictive, actionable insights.

Shared data ecosystem – multiple stakeholders (farmers, resorts, disaster authorities) can access the same dashboard through a subscription model, creating a sustainable revenue stream.

By combining technology, accessibility, and predictive power, ClimMaTech delivers a “never-before” solution that enhances climate resilience and safeguards lives, agriculture, and infrastructure.","Our primary customers are local communities, farmers, resorts, and disaster management authorities in flood-prone regions. These stakeholders face the highest risk from sudden floods and cloudbursts but lack access to reliable, affordable, and predictive monitoring solutions.

For farmers, timely alerts about river flow and rainfall mean they can protect standing crops, optimize irrigation, and reduce losses. Resorts and tourism operators in valleys and riverbanks need real-time monitoring to ensure guest safety and minimize property damage, while government authorities and disaster management agencies require continuous data to make informed evacuation and response decisions.

Our unique insight is that most existing solutions are either too costly or fragmented, leaving smaller communities and individual businesses underserved. Current systems focus on isolated data points—such as rainfall or water depth—without combining them into predictive, actionable insights. Through our pilots, we have observed that customers value not only real-time monitoring but also predictive intelligence and shared dashboard access, which allows multiple stakeholders to benefit from the same data ecosystem at an affordable subscription.

This project not only demonstrated his expertise in IoT hardware and communication protocols (RS485, Modbus, 4–20mA integration) but also laid the foundation for designing rugged, scalable sensor networks—experience that directly contributes to ClimMaTech’s flood monitoring and forecasting solution.","At ClimMaTech, we understand that flood resilience is not just about collecting data, but about delivering actionable intelligence to the right people at the right time. Many companies focus only on building expensive monitoring hardware or isolated weather stations. The missing link is affordability, accessibility, and predictive power.

Our unique insight is that communities, farmers, resorts, and even government agencies don’t just want raw numbers about rainfall or river depth—they want clear, predictive alerts and insights they can act upon. For example, a farmer needs to know whether his fields will flood tomorrow, not just today’s river depth. A resort owner cares about a warning system that protects guests without hiring technical staff to interpret data.

This is why our business combines low-cost IoT devices, AI-driven forecasts, and a shared subscription dashboard. By designing for scalability and inclusivity, we ensure that even small communities and businesses can afford cutting-edge climate resilience tools.

These instabilities arise from a complex feedback loop between pressure oscillations and unsteady heat release within the combustion chamber, which amplifies acoustic waves and can lead to destructive self-sustaining vibrations, potentially resulting in engine damage or catastrophic failure. Therefore, accurate prediction and control of such instabilities are crucial for the development of reliable and high-performance engines for future space missions. This study conducts a numerical investigation of thermoacoustic instabilities in rocket combustion chambers using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation framework incorporates three key physics modules: Pressure Acoustics (Frequency Domain) to simulate sound wave propagation and identify resonant modes (eigenfrequencies and mode shapes); Heat Transfer in Solids and Fluids to model energy exchange processes that couple heat release with acoustics; and Transport of Diluted Species to simulate the diffusion and convection of reactants and products, forming the basis for combustion modeling. The interaction between pressure oscillations and unsteady heat release is represented using a modified n–τ flame model, adapted for frequency-domain analysis. This model links heat release fluctuations to earlier perturbations in species concentration and pressure, accounting for convective delay (τ). While a simplified single-step irreversible reaction is used to represent combustion chemistry, the framework effectively captures the key nonlinear, time-lagged flame response to acoustic perturbations. This enables a reliable linear stability analysis to assess the growth or decay of acoustic modes. The initial study is conducted to find out the design parameters leveraging this integrated model, systematic parametric studies are integrated to dissect how key design parameters influence stability including Chamber Geometry, Injector Design, Flame Characteristics and Boundary Conditions. Special focus is placed on finding the prevailing instability modes (longitudinal and transverse), the system eigenfrequencies, and the comprehensive effect of boundary conditions including regenerative cooling simulation in the lower coils. This is used to model fluid structure interaction, wherein not just one rocket engine, but its interaction with the neighboring set of engines and the spark ignitors and ROFI chambers is modeled. This research enhances the understanding of the mechanisms driving instabilities in rocket engines during launch operations. It establishes a simulation-driven framework for evaluating various damping strategies, such as Helmholtz resonators and baffle inserts. The approach allows for the identification of dominant unstable modes, measurement of their growth rates, visualization of their spatial patterns (mode shapes), and determination of critical eigenfrequencies",Static air purifers based on locally situated sensors don't give the acrual picture of the polutation maps in the room. They also are very restricting as their ability drops drastically when ventilation is introduced.,Can we change our pitch deck and elevator pitch later on?

Patients frequently lose prescriptions, lab reports, and medical histories, resulting in repeated tests, inconsistent treatments, and missed opportunities for preventive care. There is no easy way for different clinics, hospitals, and diagnostic centres to share patient information securely, leaving critical data locked in silos. The absence of integrated EMR (Electronic Medical Records) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems at scale is a major bottleneck. The result is a healthcare system where neither the patient nor the provider has a complete picture of health history, risk factors, or preventive opportunities. We are solving this gap by enabling seamless, secure, and intelligent health data management across the ecosystem.“In a world where we can track a pizza in real time, we still can’t track our own health history.”","India’s pharmaceutical industry faces a silent but costly challenge: a data gap that slows innovation and inflates costs.

Lacking robust, large-scale Indian health datasets, pharma giants are forced to rely on foreign clinical data that often fails to capture the unique genetic makeup, lifestyle patterns, and disease profiles of India’s population. As a result, developing effective, India-specific medicines becomes harder.

The absence of unified, accessible patient records makes local clinical trials expensive and time-consuming. Companies spend huge sums repeating trial phases, delaying the arrival of life-saving drugs to market.

This fragmented data landscape also means missed opportunities, from identifying trial participants faster to tracking real-world treatment outcomes and tailoring therapies to Indian needs.

A connected health data vault could change everything, giving pharma secure, anonymised access to comprehensive Indian datasets, cutting R&D costs, accelerating trials, and empowering the creation of safer, more effective medicines for millions.","Our solution stands truly unparalleled and uniquely positioned as one of the only in India. Unlike existing players, who often focus on fragmented offerings or limited digital record-keeping, we are pioneering India’s first fully integrated, secure, and intelligent Health Data Vault that connects patients, doctors, hospitals, labs, and pharmaceutical companies on a single platform.

What makes us the first and only in this space is our comprehensive approach:

End-to-End Connectivity: We don’t just digitise records; we create a seamless ecosystem across the entire healthcare landscape, from individual patients to the largest pharma companies, ensuring continuous and contextualised health data flow.

Industry-Driven Innovation: Our solution is crafted from direct, high-level consultations with top executives of India’s biggest pharma and healthcare organisations, giving us unique, insider insight into industry pain points and needs that no other player has matched or addressed at this scale.

Scale and Security: We combine cutting-edge encryption and privacy controls with the ability to handle health data for over a billion Indians, delivering a system robust enough for nationwide deployment but personal enough for every patient.

Pharma-Grade Data Utility: We offer pharma companies anonymised, real-world Indian health data for the first time ever, cutting dependence on foreign datasets, slashing trial costs, and accelerating India-specific drug discovery, something no other Indian business has realised at this scale.

In essence, by uniting all stakeholders through a first-ever HEALTH DATA VAULT built with unmatched industry insight and national scale, we are not just entering a market, we are creating a new category and setting the gold standard for healthcare digitisation in India. This is why we are truly the FIRST and ONLY business delivering this transformative solution.","Our primary customers will be small and medium-sized healthcare providers, including solo practitioners, polyclinics, and hospitals, especially in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities across India.

We are also planning to sell to small hospital chains and diagnostic centres seeking scalable software to streamline operations, unify patient records across locations, and improve regulatory compliance.

To expand our ecosystem, we will offer a freemium patient app that allows patients to access their prescriptions, schedule appointments, and receive reminders, building direct engagement and loyalty between providers and patients at no upfront cost.

Starting with a small team of volunteers, we organised workshops tailored to the unique challenges these communities face, focusing on leadership and skill development. Our deep community engagement allowed us to build trust and create programs that truly made an impact. We are now an international group with volunteers from Asia, Africa and North America.

Our work attracted support from individuals, corporate partners, and donors. Through a combination of grassroots fundraising events, online campaigns, and partnerships, we successfully raised ₹80 lakhs. These funds helped us expand learning centres, reach more beneficiaries, and launch sustainable initiatives that have transformed hundreds of lives.

Recognising our impact, I was honoured to be recommended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand to represent youth at the UN ECOSOC Youth Forum 2025, amplifying voices from marginalised communities on a global platform. This recognition motivates me to continue driving social change through innovative and inclusive solutions.

This journey has not only shaped my leadership but also fueled my passion to build tech-driven healthcare solutions that reach those most in need, ensuring no one is left behind in the digital revolution.","Ever since I was a child, I’ve grown up surrounded by stories from my doctor uncles about the daily struggles of running clinics, missed patient records, poor coordination with labs, and the frustration of slow, unresponsive tech support. These weren’t just isolated problems; they were systemic inefficiencies deeply embedded in India’s healthcare.

Years later, while pursuing an internship in cancer biology at Yale University, I saw the opposite end of the spectrum, highly integrated, efficient systems delivering care at scale. That contrast made the gap in Indian healthcare even starker. Most existing solutions in India cater to large urban hospitals, leaving small and mid-sized clinics, especially in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, underserved. And when technology is introduced, it’s often too complex, expensive, or poorly supported to truly work for them.

That’s why we built our startup differently. We designed a simple, affordable platform that connects doctors, patients, labs, and pharmacies seamlessly. Our freemium patient app and hands-on customer support make adoption smooth, while our deep understanding of grassroots challenges ensures the solution fits into real-world workflows. This isn’t just software, it’s a bridge across a healthcare gap I’ve been seeing my whole life.",We would love to get any feedback from you for our idea and the direction we are heading towards.

Rising costs & chemical dependency – Expensive pesticides strain already thin profit margins.

Diminishing effectiveness – Pests are developing resistance, forcing more frequent and heavier applications.

Health & safety risks – Exposure to toxic residues harms farmers, consumers, and rural communities.

Environmental damage – Soil degradation, water contamination, and biodiversity loss from chemical overuse.

Lack of viable alternatives – Most eco-friendly solutions are either too costly or not tailored for smallholder needs.

This trap keeps millions of farmers stuck in a cycle of unsustainable farming, low productivity, and vulnerability to climate shocks.

What makes it unique:

Innovative Mode of Action: By triggering plants’ natural defences, Azeedo Shield offers broad-spectrum, long-lasting protection against pests and diseases without leaving toxic residues.

Circular Economy Approach: It is made from a locally abundant invasive weed, turning an environmental problem into a valuable agricultural input, keeping production costs low and supporting ecological restoration.

Farmer-Centric Design: Affordable (₹1,500/litre), compatible with existing spraying equipment, and easy to use—ideal for small and marginal farmers.

Proven Efficacy: Field results in India show 100% control of mealybugs within 24 hours, complete suppression of major fungal diseases (Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Alternaria solani), and up to 19% yield enhancement in chilli, with 60% reduction in chemical pesticide use.

Safe & Sustainable: Non-toxic to humans, animals, and beneficial insects, and residue-free, protecting both health and the environment.

In short, Azeedo Shield uniquely combines advanced plant science, environmentally responsible sourcing, and affordability to break farmers’ dependency on chemical pesticides while boosting productivity and resilience.","Azeedo is primarily selling to small and marginal farmers—the backbone of India’s agriculture—who are most affected by the high costs, health risks, and declining effectiveness of chemical pesticides.

Our target customers include:

Individual smallholder farmers seeking affordable, safe, and easy-to-use crop protection solutions.

Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and cooperatives that procure inputs collectively for their members.

Agricultural input distributors and retailers who supply products to rural markets.

NGOs and agri-development programs working on sustainable agriculture and farmer welfare.

Agri-institutions and government programs promoting eco-friendly farming practices.

In future expansion plans—such as into the Australian market—we will target:

Commercial-scale farmers facing pest and disease losses.

Organic and sustainable farming enterprises looking for residue-free crop protection.

Agri-cooperatives and distribution networks catering to large farming communities.

Starting from lab-scale bioformulation research, I spearheaded pilot programs across multiple states in collaboration with Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agricultural universities, and NGOs. This project involved demonstrating the product’s efficacy against major pests and diseases—achieving 100% control of mealybugs within 24 hours, complete suppression of fungal pathogens like Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Alternaria solani, and a 19% yield increase in chilli crops. Beyond technical validation, this initiative introduced sustainable crop protection to over 100 farmers, reducing chemical pesticide usage by up to 60% and lowering input costs, proving the product’s potential for large-scale adoption and deep environmental impact.","What sets our business, Azeedo, apart from other companies is our deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by small and marginal farmers in India and similar agricultural contexts, such as Australia. While many companies offer crop protection products, we recognize the critical need for solutions that are not only effective but also affordable, safe, and environmentally sustainable for resource-constrained farmers.

Unlike conventional chemical pesticides, which pose health risks, contribute to environmental degradation, and often become less effective due to pest resistance, Azeedo leverages advanced Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) technology to activate the plant's own natural immunity. This approach provides broad-spectrum and long-lasting protection without harmful residues.

Moreover, our business model is built around a circular economy principle by utilizing a locally abundant invasive weed as the raw material for Azeedo Shield. This not only creates a sustainable supply chain but also helps restore ecosystems by turning an ecological problem into a valuable agricultural input—a nuance many competitors overlook.

We have demonstrated through extensive field trials and partnerships with farmers and institutions that Azeedo Shield can reduce chemical pesticide use by up to 60%, boost yields by 12–25%, and enhance profitability—all while being safe for farmers, consumers, and beneficial insects.

In essence, Azeedo uniquely combines cutting-edge science, ecological insight, farmer-centric design, and social impact focus. This holistic understanding of agricultural, environmental, and socioeconomic factors enables us to create solutions that truly resonate with and empower smallholder farmers—an insight that distinguishes us in the agritech landscape.",NA

Professional solutions like transplants are often expensive, invasive, and unaffordable for over 90% of the population. At the same time, most over-the-counter products fail to provide personalized care, leaving 85% of people desiring solutions tailored to their unique scalp and hair conditions.

Folicle AI solves this by combining advanced AI-driven diagnostics with organic, customized treatment kits and next-generation 3D follicle bioprinting. Our platform ensures accurate assessment of scalp health, delivers affordable, chemical-free regimens, and provides a sustainable alternative for severe baldness without donor hair dependency. Beyond aesthetics, we also address the psychological and social impact of hair loss—nearly 60% of individuals report its negative effect on confidence and career opportunities.

By bridging affordability, personalization, and scientific innovation, Folicle AI eliminates misdiagnosis, reduces wasted expenditure, and creates a reliable path to long-term regrowth and scalp health. Our mission is to democratize effective hair restoration while making it sustainable, inclusive, and accessible for everyone.","Hair loss is more than just a cosmetic issue—it affects confidence, self-esteem, and even career opportunities. Many people spend years trying shampoos, oils, and expensive treatments, only to be disappointed. Around 65% of people end up with the wrong diagnosis, while 40% waste money on solutions that don’t work. Professional treatments like transplants are out of reach for most, with over 90% unable to afford them.

On the other side, affordable products are mostly generic. They don’t consider individual scalp conditions, leaving 85% of people frustrated and still searching for answers. The result is not just hair loss, but also a loss of hope and trust in available options.

We are solving this by offering a personalized, science-backed path to hair health. Our AI scans understand your scalp, our organic kits provide safe and affordable care, and our 3D bioprinting technology creates a solution for those with advanced hair loss. In simple terms—we aim to give people their confidence back, with treatments that truly work and don’t break the bank.","Our unique solution lies in building a complete ecosystem for hair restoration that bridges the gap between affordability, personalization, and scientific innovation. Unlike generic products or costly transplants, we combine three core innovations into one platform.

First, our AI-powered scalp diagnostic tool analyzes individual scalp and hair conditions with high accuracy. This ensures that users no longer rely on trial-and-error or misdiagnosed treatments. By understanding scalp health at a micro level, we can design truly personalized care.

Second, we provide customized organic treatment kits tailored to each individual. These are chemical-free, sustainable, and designed to target specific conditions such as thinning, dandruff, or early-stage baldness. The focus is on safe, effective, and affordable care that works over time.

Finally, for those with advanced hair loss, our 3D follicle bioprinting technology offers a breakthrough solution. By creating lab-grown follicles that integrate naturally into the scalp, we remove the need for donor hair and painful surgical procedures. This innovation makes long-term regrowth possible for people who otherwise have limited options.

Together, these three layers form a seamless, end-to-end solution—accessible, personalized, and backed by science—helping people not only restore their hair but also their confidence and quality of life.","Our primary customers are individuals experiencing hair loss, thinning, or scalp-related issues, typically between the ages of 20–45. This group includes students, young professionals, and working adults who often face the social and emotional impact of hair loss at an early stage.

By enabling a circular economy through vermicompost production from fiber sap, Banapack empowers agricultural communities and advances India’s journey toward green packaging and sustainable food systems.","Banapack delivers a sustainable packaging solution for the agricultural sector by transforming banana fiber—an abundant, biodegradable agricultural byproduct—into advanced packaging materials. Our innovation lies in hybrid cardboard options comprising 10%, 50%, and 100% banana fiber pulp, allowing us to tailor durability and cost-effectiveness to different market segments. This approach not only offers shock absorption and cushioning, significantly reducing bruising and post-harvest losses during transportation, but also replaces single-use plastics with an eco-friendly alternative. The leftover pulp generated during banana fiber extraction are processed into high-quality vermicompost, creating a zero-waste circular economy that supplies farmers with nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and an additional income stream. The packaging incorporates a banana fiber paper layer to minimize fruit abrasion, further preserving produce quality. Critically, Banapack’s solution is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, requiring no significant process changes or specialized training, which accelerates adoption. By upcycling nearly 60% of banana plant biomass that would otherwise be discarded and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, Banapack reduces environmental pollution while generating economic value for farming communities. Our scalable, cost-competitive products are poised to appeal to premium retailers, grocers, and exporters, positioning Banapack as a force in India’s shift toward sustainable packaging.","Banapack’s consumer base is strategically prioritized to maximize both market adoption and impact. 1. Retailers—including premium outlets like Reliance Fresh, Star Bazaar, and BigBasket, as well as mid-sized grocery chains—are our foremost customers. These businesses are under increasing pressure to shift to eco-friendly packaging due to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory requirements. By offering sustainable, high-quality alternatives that appeal to environmentally conscious shoppers, Banapack enables retailers to enhance their brand value while reducing plastic waste. 2. Exporters require packaging that meets strict international standards for food safety and sustainability. As they ship fresh produce to regulated global markets (such as the EU, US, and Australia), exporters seek certified, biodegradable packaging that protects products during long-distance transport and ensures compliance with foreign regulations. Banapack addresses this critical need, helping exporters access premium markets and minimize spoilage. 3. Farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in states like Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh are also key users. These regions are major banana producers and export hubs, facing substantial post-harvest losses due to inadequate packaging.

This gap leaves millions grappling with uncertainty, inconvenience, and anxiety when faced with urgent but non-life-threatening medical needs. VYTAL is engineered to fill this void, introducing a new category of  ""Healthcare at home"". Accessing primary and urgent care in urban India is filled with friction. The typical patient journey for a non-emergency but urgent issue such as a sudden high fever, a minor injury, or an alarming symptom for a chronic condition involves a series of inconvenient and stressful steps.Patients often resort to risky self-diagnosis, endure long waiting times at crowded clinics, or face the high cost and anxiety of an unnecessary visit to a hospital emergency room. This systemic inefficiency creates a significant, unaddressed market need.","While government-run services like 108 EMRI provide a critical safety net, they are designed for high-acuity emergencies and patient transport, not for on-the-spot diagnostics and treatment of less severe issues. The average response time for the 108 service in Gujarat is 19 minutes, which, while commendable, underscores its focus on transport rather than immediate at-home care. National data suggests even longer response times in other areas, highlighting a nationwide opportunity for a faster, more specialised service layer. This leaves a vast ""service void"" for the majority of day-to-day medical concerns that fall between a routine check-up and a life-threatening event.
The current urban healthcare system is highly fragmented. A doctor's consultation, a diagnostic test at a lab, and a pharmacy purchase are typically disconnected events. This lack of integration prevents the creation of a longitudinal health record and inhibits the potential for a proactive care loop that could prevent future health crises. This fragmentation leads to operational inefficiencies, redundant processes, and missed opportunities for preventive medicine.","We are developing a tech powered, on-demand healthcare delivery platform that dispatches paramedics to a patient's doorstep within 15 minutes. A paramedic at your home,on your demand not only provides you a sense of placebo (because of the doctors validation) and relief but also starts keeping a check on your potential health shortcomings by maintaining a database of your vitals.The on-site paramedic can act as a vital link to higher medical expertise. Using the paramedic's field app, they can facilitate an immediate and secure video consultation between the patient and a remote physician.The database will be maintained through the regular health checkups the patient can take through our services. Hence VYTAL also helps to make a preventive medicine system because it is designed to bridge this ecosystem void by integrating you test reports,doctor consultation, regular vital checks and medicine into a single, seamless platform. We also aim to seamlessly sync with a wide range of consumer-grade, home-installed health monitoring devices, such as Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuffs and glucometers. This continuous stream of patient-generated health data is crucial for our proactive and preventive care models, allowing for long-term health trend analysisWe are fundamentally shifting healthcare from a destination one must travel to, into a service that is available anytime, anywhere, on demand.","A typical person on our platform could be anywhere from a 80 year old to a family with a newly born.India has a large and growing elderly population. In Gujarat alone, 51.3% of senior citizens suffer from at least one chronic disease, with hypertension (24.3%) and diabetes (12.4%) being the most prevalent.Patients with these conditions require regular monitoring of vitals such as blood pressure and glucose levels. The current process is cumbersome and reactive, relying on periodic clinic visits.
This demographic faces significant mobility challenges, making frequent and often physically taxing trips to clinics for routine monitoring a major burden. This same patient has adult children who living away from their aging parents.This demographic possesses disposable income and is highly motivated to ensure the well-being of their loved ones.
And then there comes the upcoming health conscious population who have disposable income to spend on their health for Gym trainers, sleep trackers, whoop bands etc. We will cater to this audience by reducing the mess they wanna avoid by going to a hospital and booking a health checkup, maybe even lining up in queues for those tests to be conducted.

I watched my grandparents, people who had given me so much, become defined by their chronic illnesses. The constant doctor visits, the confusing medications, the exhaustion of navigating a broken system was an emotional toll as much as a physical one.

This feeling hit even closer to home when I thought about my parents. The terrifying realisation that in a decade, they could be facing the same issues is what truly scared me. When you hear that you're prediabetic, there's a moment of reckoning. You realise there's no going back to the way things were. The only way forward is to take control, to act on your regular health checkups before a full-blown diagnosis is the only solution.
Our business isn't just about managing health; it's about providing a support system for their life. It's about giving them the clarity and the tools to be proactive, so they can live with confidence instead of fear. We're here to ease the emotional burden of navigating chronic illness, not just the physical one. We understand that behind every health metric is a human being with a life they want to protect. That's a perspective no other company has.Our customers aren't just patients; they are sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, all seeking to avoid that devastating feeling of helplessness.

This results in loss of independence, discomfort, stigma, and exclusion from everyday fashion. Aavaran addresses this by delivering affordable, dignified, and fashion-forward adaptive apparel and footwear tailored to Indian needs.","Aavaran is building India’s first inclusive fashion brand focused on making adaptive apparel and footwear both stylish and affordable. Our mission is to redefine adaptive fashion not as a medical necessity or luxury, but as a dignified, everyday choice accessible to millions. What sets us apart is our unique blend of localized manufacturing—reducing costs by 60–70% compared to imports—and human-centered design. We co-create every product with input from people with disabilities, caregivers, physiotherapists, and rehabilitation experts to ensure real-world functionality without compromising on style.
We are starting with adaptive footwear—an underserved yet highly standardized segment. Our designs feature thoughtful innovations such as wide openings with zip closures, breathable materials, removable insoles to accommodate orthotics, and antimicrobial linings for hygiene and comfort. These features address common challenges faced by people with mobility impairments, prosthetic users, and elderly individuals with conditions like arthritis and Parkinson’s.
In the long term, we will expand into adaptive knitwear and apparel to become a one-stop solution for inclusive fashion in India. By combining affordability, cultural relevance, and aesthetic appeal, Aavaran delivers more than just clothing—we offer independence, confidence, and self-expression through fashion that includes everyone.","Our primary customers are individuals with mobility impairments and prosthetic users, particularly those wearing Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs), who face daily challenges with conventional footwear and clothing. These products are often difficult to wear independently, uncomfortable over assistive devices, or simply not designed with their needs in mind. Our secondary audience includes India’s rapidly growing elderly population—many of whom experience age-related conditions such as arthritis or Parkinson’s—that make dressing and footwear a daily struggle.

Through extensive community engagement, we've discovered a consistent desire across these groups: the need for products that support independence, comfort, and dignity—without compromising on aesthetics or affordability. In addition, we serve convenience-seeking consumers who appreciate adaptive design for its ease of use, regardless of ability.
On the institutional side, we work with rehabilitation centers, hospitals, orthotists, and NGOs who often serve as first points of contact for patients needing adaptive solutions. This dual B2C and B2B approach allows us to create deep, direct impact while also scaling reach through trusted healthcare and social channels.
Our unique insight lies in recognizing that adaptive fashion must be functional and aspirational—addressing physical needs while empowering self-expression across diverse Indian contexts.",0,NA,NA,1.5 Lakhs,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TGz4r73mi4fAWS0Rd8nCVx5NT6ADaIti?usp=sharing,No,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TGz4r73mi4fAWS0Rd8nCVx5NT6ADaIti?usp=sharing,"One of our team members previously worked on Project Leher, an award-winning social enterprise by Enactus SRCC that tackled the global menace of cigarette butt waste.

Leher created employment for over 120 people, recycled 33+ million cigarette butts, and protected 16.9 billion liters of ocean water. The project was recognized globally. This experience equipped our team with proven expertise in problem identification, waste-to-value innovation, impact scaling, and stakeholder engagement skills we now bring to building Aavaran.","Most companies view adaptive apparel as either a niche medical aid or a luxury fashion add-on. At Aavaran, we believe it’s about more than just function it’s about dignity, affordability, and cultural relevance. Through in-depth research with over 80 disabled individuals and caregivers, we've learned that people value independence and self-expression just as much as comfort. While global brands often design for Western bodies and climates, and many Indian NGOs sacrifice design and scalability, we focus on creating standardized, stylish, and India-specific solutions that can reach millions across Tier II and III cities.

The hackathon was organised in collaboration between Google & T-Hub for which the top 40 teams were invited for the final 24 hour hack where our team managed to clinch the top 6 spot.

Problem: 85% farmers in India are small & marginal with less then 2 hectares of land. The only way to improve their lifestyle is either improving yield efficiency or crop diversification into high value crops for which they lack the following knowledge about their farm which makes them risk averse:

1. Quality & type of soil?
2. Fertiliser types for maximum yield?
3. High value crop yields?

Solution: We built an android application that employs a realistic virtual simulation of the farmer's land. Through an intuitive interface and augmented reality (AR) technology, farmers navigate their actual farm boundaries, allowing the app to pinpoint precise coordinates. Leveraging APIs, real-time satellite imagery, weather data, and climate information, the app generates a comprehensive virtual representation of the farmer's land, including soil type and other pertinent details.

This virtual simulation is seamlessly integrated with an advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning model. This model analyzes the gathered data to optimise fertiliser selection and enhance yield efficiency. Moreover, it offers tailored recommendations for crop diversification, suggesting high-value crops that align with the specific conditions of the farmer's land.

Result: 

1. Improve yield efficiency
2. Crop diversification
3. Increase profitability

Note: This received project got recognition from SDE mentors at Google & Agriculture mentors from T-Hub at the Hack4Change at ISB Hyderabad.","We understand that shoots are a creative process with nuances personal to the user, it should not be mechanical in nature.

CLEAR is an all-in-one platform where users request a service and receive real-time bids from verified local providers. They choose based on price, rating, and ETA giving them control, trust, and convenience.
How does it work?
When a user submits a service request, nearby verified providers receive a notification. They respond with a price and ETA, which is shown live to the user. The user selects the best fit and confirms booking.
CLEAR is built around unique principles:
A bidding system that promotes price transparency and faster bookings
A mutual review system to build trust for both users and providers

CoMBacGeMi aims to elucidate the molecular basis of functional diversity observed in medically significant bacterial species, such as Escherichia coli. The method employs a library of strains, each harboring a conjugative plasmid integrated at a random position in the genome. In this study, we employed CoMBacGeMi to investigate the effect of a mutant matP recipient on the bias in recombination frequency observed at the terminus. Analysis of the pools revealed that MatP does not significantly regulate the recombination pattern. To go beyond a single locus and to investigate the recombination pattern across the entire genome, we utilized the Hfr library and the recipient tse2 library. Our results revealed that the recombination frequencies across the genome were non-uniform, with regions such as the Ter macrodomain exhibiting low recombination frequencies. Additionally, we observed that the conjugation efficiencies of recipient clones were related to the position of the loci of selection in the genome. Lastly, we tested the ability of CoMBacGeMi to identify specific targets of selection. Analysis of the pools enabled us to identify, with precision, the three distinct insertion positions of tse2 in the three tested clones.

 But the main part of our solution is giving Tier-3 housewives more power.  We give them free garden kits, easy training, and most importantly, we promise to buy back what they grow.  This turns empty rooftops into small farms and stay-at-home moms into people who make money.

 Urban Harvest makes a circular ecosystem by putting these three layers together. This makes spaces greener and healthier for businesses and families, and it gives women jobs and respect.","Our main clients are businesses that want to make their workplaces more environmentally friendly in order to improve employee health and reach their ESG goals.  As part of their efforts to be more environmentally friendly and healthy, they put money into rooftop gardens.

 We also sell to middle-class families in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities who want to bring nature into their homes in a cheap, easy way while enjoying fresh herbs and vegetables.

 Our ecosystem helps housewives in Tier-3 cities in an indirect way.  They aren't direct buyers, but they become important partners when we give them kits through corporate sponsorships and set up a steady supply chain for produce.

 This model with many sides makes sure that there is always demand: companies buy for health, families buy for lifestyle, and housewives make money by supplying.  They work together to create a marketplace for green living that can grow and support itself.",0,NA,NA,500000 Rupees,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jgE_uHrjK0_v66CBCHGtxgboCTXsCF9C/view?usp=sharing,No,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wmMsdE5WzG3a-jOoShK7jDLJ8XeYcrUr?usp=sharing,"ResQ: A Smart Ambulance Preemption System
 ResQ is an Internet of Things (IoT) solution that helps ambulances get through traffic signals faster.  There is a GPS tracker in the ambulance that talks to a central server over a secure private 5G line.  The server checks the ambulance's location within a set geofence as it gets closer to a traffic light. It then automatically sends instructions to the smart microcontroller that is built into the traffic light controller.  This makes sure that the signal turns green for the ambulance route, which speeds up emergency response.  The system also lets drivers confirm their actions through encrypted messaging, which makes it both safe and reliable. It also works with traffic lights that are already in place without needing expensive upgrades to the infrastructure.","Most companies that do rooftop gardening see it as either a product business (selling kits) or a service business (installing gardens for businesses).  What they don't get is that green spaces aren't just about plants; they're also about health, beauty, and giving people power.

 We see things differently when we say that rooftops can become a triple-impact ecosystem:

 For businesses, it's not about making food; it's about health, oxygen, and making workspaces that make people feel good.

 For families, it's not about farming; it's about having a pretty, low-maintenance green space that makes homegrown food look good and makes people trust it.

 For housewives, it's not just a hobby; it's a way to make money, and buy-back means they don't have to worry about markets or logistics.

 No other company has put together a single scalable model that combines wellness, beauty, and women's empowerment in this way.  That's what sets us apart.",NA

Mobility challenges often lead to accidents, reliance on others, and restricted access to education, employment, and public spaces. Current assistive technologies, such as smart canes, vision glasses, or mobile apps, provide only fragmented solutions—offering limited obstacle detection, partial navigation support, or basic object recognition. These tools lack comprehensive environmental awareness, personalization, and contextual guidance, leaving critical gaps in safety, usability, and inclusivity.

Our startup addresses this problem by developing Disha AI, a holistic wearable solution that integrates 360° environmental sensing, AI-powered object and facial recognition, real-time navigation, and conversational voice interaction. Unlike existing devices, Disha AI learns user habits, adapts to individual needs, and provides proactive assistance. By bridging these gaps, we aim to significantly enhance independence, safety, and confidence for visually impaired individuals, enabling them to live fuller, more connected lives.","Visually impaired individuals face immense challenges in their daily lives, primarily in safe navigation, obstacle detection, and social interaction. These difficulties often result in reduced independence, safety risks, and reliance on others for basic mobility. For example, navigating crowded streets, identifying familiar faces, or detecting potential hazards can become overwhelming and dangerous. This not only affects personal freedom but also restricts access to education, employment, and social participation, leading to exclusion from mainstream society.

Existing assistive tools like smart canes, vision glasses, or mobile apps provide only fragmented solutions, offering limited obstacle sensing, basic navigation, or object recognition. They often lack personalization, contextual awareness, and comprehensive support, making them insufficient for addressing the real needs of visually impaired individuals. Moreover, many of these solutions are expensive, bulky, or reliant on constant internet connectivity, further limiting accessibility.

Our startup aims to solve this by developing Disha AI, a wearable companion that integrates 360° multi-camera coverage, AI-powered recognition, and conversational voice interaction to provide holistic support. By offering real-time navigation, personalized guidance, and social interaction support in an affordable and user-friendly design, we strive to bridge the critical gap in assistive technology and empower visually impaired individuals with safety, independence, and confidence.","Our unique solution, Disha AI, is a wearable AI-powered companion that empowers visually impaired individuals with independence, safety, and social inclusion. Unlike existing fragmented tools such as smart canes or vision glasses, Disha AI provides a comprehensive solution by combining multiple technologies into a single device.

It uses 360° multi-camera coverage, depth sensors, and AI-driven computer vision to capture and interpret the environment in real time. The system identifies objects, obstacles, and faces, while also mapping spatial relationships to enhance environmental awareness. This is communicated to the user through a friendly, conversational voice interface, offering real-time and context-aware guidance rather than simple alerts.

A key differentiator is Disha’s ability to learn user habits and preferences, providing personalized support that evolves over time. Designed to work both online and offline, Disha AI ensures reliability, affordability, and ease of use, making it a holistic innovation for the visually impaired.","We are selling to both end users (visually impaired individuals) and institutional partners who support them. Our primary customers are visually impaired individuals seeking greater independence, safety, and confidence in their daily lives. According to the WHO, over 2.2 billion people globally live with some form of vision impairment, with around 550 million in India alone, making this a large and growing market.

In addition to individual users, we will target NGOs, rehabilitation centers, government welfare programs, and educational institutions that support accessibility initiatives for the visually impaired. These organizations can act as key distribution channels, helping us reach beneficiaries more effectively. We also plan to collaborate with corporate CSR programs that invest in assistive technologies for social impact.

At small scale this is manageable, but at industrial or infrastructure scale, battery replacement and wiring costs become a nightmare. Batteries fail within months or a few years, leading to high maintenance overheads, downtime, and waste. Wiring retrofits are expensive, disruptive, and often impractical in large facilities, warehouses, or remote environments.

Jouleless is solving this by building batteryless, wireless IoT sensors powered by ambient energy sources like indoor solar and RF. Our sensors harvest energy continuously from the environment, eliminating the need for battery replacement or complex wiring. This makes them maintenance-free, scalable, and sustainable.

The problem we are addressing is two-fold:

Scalability bottleneck – current IoT deployments cannot scale affordably due to maintenance and service overheads.

Sustainability gap – billions of IoT batteries end up as e-waste every year.

By removing batteries and wiring from the equation, Jouleless enables businesses to deploy IoT at scale for applications like HVAC efficiency, cold chain monitoring, industrial safety, and smart infrastructure. This solves a major cost, reliability, and sustainability challenge in IoT adoption.","Most IoT solutions today depend on either batteries or wiring.

This solves a major cost, reliability, and sustainability challenge in IoT adoption.","Our unique solution is a new class of batteryless, wireless IoT sensors that run entirely on ambient energy harvesting by using indoor solar, RF, and other sources. Unlike conventional IoT devices that rely on disposable batteries or costly wiring, our sensors are designed to be self-powered, maintenance-free, and scalable.

At the hardware level, we integrate indoor photovoltaic panels, energy-harvesting PMICs, and supercapacitor storage with ultra-low-power microcontrollers. These nodes collect environmental data (temperature, humidity, air quality, CO₂) and transmit wirelessly over BLE to a gateway, which pushes data to the cloud. For reliability, we also offer optional fallback modules such as GSM for remote sites.

This design removes the need for periodic servicing, dramatically reduces total cost of ownership, and eliminates battery e-waste. It enables deployments in locations where power and maintenance access are limited, making IoT practical for industrial, commercial, and infrastructure-scale applications.

The uniqueness lies in our system-level co-design of power, communication, and sensing, optimized specifically for energy-harvested operation, which existing battery-powered solutions cannot replicate.","We are selling to enterprises and operators in sectors where large-scale sensing is critical but maintenance is a bottleneck. Our primary target customers include:

HVAC and building management companies that need real-time temperature and humidity monitoring for energy-efficient operations without costly wiring or battery replacements.

Cold chain logistics providers in pharma and food, who require continuous temperature traceability in warehouses, trucks, and storage rooms where servicing sensors is impractical.

Industrial facilities such as chemical plants, where gas and environmental monitoring is essential for safety but traditional sensors are difficult to maintain.

In the longer term, we see significant opportunity in retail and CPG, where billions of items and shelves can be instrumented using ambient IoT, unlocking data-driven insights across supply chains.

As part of this work, he developed a 4-layer flight management unit (FMU) PCB and engineered flexible PCB connections to integrate the IMU and FMU, resulting in a more compact design and enhanced overall system performance.","Most IoT companies see sensors as disposable hardware, either wired or battery-powered, and treat maintenance as an unavoidable cost. We believe this is the wrong starting point. The real barrier to IoT at scale isn’t connectivity or sensor accuracy, it’s the hidden O&M costs of replacing millions of batteries and maintaining complex wiring.

What we understand is that true scalability in IoT is only possible if sensors are maintenance-free. By designing our systems to run entirely on ambient energy from the ground up, we’re addressing this bottleneck directly rather than layering software or analytics on top of fragile hardware.

This perspective also changes how we design: our hardware, firmware, and communication protocols are co-optimized for energy harvesting. Competing solutions typically retrofit existing devices with “low-power modes” or bigger batteries, which only delays the maintenance problem.

We see batteryless operation not as a niche but as the foundation for the next wave of IoT, especially in sectors like HVAC, cold chain, and retail where data is valuable but deployment costs have blocked adoption. That conviction sets us apart from companies treating sustainability as an afterthought rather than a design principle.",When should we expect to hear back from you

Description:
Our team collectively developed a Node.js + Express-based system to predict attendance for alumni events and optimize workforce planning. Using RSVP data, past attendance, and distance metrics, the platform recommended the required catering and seating staff, along with resources like chairs, meals, and parking, minimizing over- or under-staffing. A simple HTML frontend allowed easy alumni search by USN and visualization of predictions.
Outcome & Skills Demonstrated:
This project showcased our team’s ability to integrate data analysis, predictive modeling, and web development to solve real-world operational challenges. We collaboratively handled backend development, algorithm design, data processing, and frontend integration, demonstrating strong teamwork and technical skills. The experience reinforced our capacity to build scalable, data-driven solutions; skills we are now applying to our traffic violation reporting platform.","We understand that road safety enforcement in India cannot rely solely on traditional infrastructure like speed cameras, which are expensive, limited in coverage, and easily bypassed. Unlike other companies that focus on hardware or general dashcam apps, we see the untapped potential of existing dashcams as a crowdsourced enforcement tool. We recognize the importance of legality, privacy, and user engagement; ensuring drivers never record while driving, automatically blurring faces, and using gamification to sustain participation.
We also foresee a future where dashcams become standard in vehicles, making B2B partnerships with manufacturers and car dealers the key to scalable impact, rather than targeting end users directly. Most companies overlook this strategic approach, focusing either on consumer apps or surveillance hardware. By combining AI-powered violation detection, privacy-first design, gamified engagement, and B2B integration, we can create a platform that is practical, scalable, and culturally adapted for India, giving us an edge in both adoption and effectiveness.","What do you look for in startups that can scale not just commercially but also make a real social impact, like ours aiming to improve road safety?"

Paper mills are extremely water and energy-intensive, creating significant pollution and resource depletion.

Simultaneously, farmers burn agricultural waste after harvesting, contributing to severe air pollution that affects millions. This creates a dual environmental disaster - trees being cut for paper while valuable agricultural waste is burned, releasing harmful emissions.

MSMEs struggle to access affordable, sustainable raw materials, limiting their ability to innovate and adopt green practices. The current system creates a vicious cycle: environmental degradation, wasted agricultural resources, farmer income loss, and limited sustainable options for businesses seeking eco-friendly alternatives.","ReLeaf Innovations transforms agricultural waste into high-quality paper through decentralized micro-units. We use rice straw and fast-growing grasses (Napier, bamboo) as raw materials instead of trees, completely eliminating deforestation.

Our eco-friendly pulping process uses 40% less water and energy than traditional mills, employing enzyme-based methods rather than harmful chemicals. The entire process is zero-plastic, producing fully compostable, chemical-free paper.

Key differentiators include: decentralized manufacturing that empowers rural entrepreneurs, converting waste that would be burned into valuable income for farmers, and rapid production cycles since grasses regrow in 3-6 months versus 8-20 years for trees.

Our solution addresses multiple problems simultaneously - reduces air pollution by eliminating stubble burning, creates rural employment through micro paper units, provides MSMEs with affordable sustainable materials, and delivers eco-conscious brands the green packaging they need. This creates a circular economy model that benefits farmers, entrepreneurs, environment, and end customers.","Our primary customers are eco-conscious brands and startups seeking sustainable packaging materials, representing a growing market segment demanding green alternatives. These companies understand that consumers increasingly prefer environmentally responsible products and are willing to pay premium prices for sustainable packaging.

MSMEs and small printers in rural and urban areas form our second major segment. They need affordable, high-quality raw materials but often lack access to sustainable options. Our unique insight is that these businesses want to go green but need cost-effective solutions - our agro-waste paper costs less than traditional alternatives while being environmentally superior.

Government agencies and NGOs promoting sustainability represent our third segment, often requiring large volumes for educational materials and awareness campaigns. Educational institutions seeking to reduce their ecological footprint also present significant opportunities.

Our key insight is that customers don't just want eco-friendly products - they want solutions that don't compromise on quality or cost-effectiveness. Traditional ""green"" alternatives often come with trade-offs. Our customers appreciate that we eliminate these trade-offs by offering superior environmental benefits, competitive pricing, and comparable quality.

The project proposed converting the body’s electrons into particles accelerated in a vacuum tube, powered by sunlight, to achieve ultra-fast, eco-friendly travel. It also explored applications such as interplanetary transport, instant object relocation, and sustainable delivery systems.","The paper industry's biggest blind spot is viewing agricultural waste as a disposal problem rather than a valuable resource. While competitors focus on recycling or marginal efficiency improvements, we recognized that India generates 600+ million tonnes of agricultural residue annually - enough to replace 60% of wood-based paper production.

Most companies don't understand the rural economic dynamics. Farmers lose ₹8,000-12,000 per acre disposing of crop residue, while paper mills pay ₹4,000-6,000 per tonne for wood pulp. We realized this creates a massive arbitrage opportunity - we can pay farmers ₹2,000 per tonne for waste, still undercutting wood pulp costs.

The decentralization insight is crucial. Traditional paper mills require massive capital and centralized operations. We discovered that micro-units near farms reduce transportation costs by 70%, create local employment, and make economics viable even at smaller scales. This distributed model also reduces environmental impact and creates resilient supply chains.

Finally, the timing advantage: government regulations increasingly favor sustainable alternatives, carbon credits are becoming valuable, and consumer preferences are shifting rapidly. Companies entering this space in 2-3 years will face higher raw material costs and established competition.",NA

UrbanNest transforms access to premium appliances into a seamless, affordable, and eco-friendly experience, tailored for today’s urban lifestyle.","UrbanNest offers a unique, tech-enabled rental solution that integrates directly into residential communities. Instead of relying on traditional rental models that involve deliveries, deposits, and delays, we install IoT-enabled smart fixtures within societies that securely house premium appliances such as Dyson vacuums, gaming consoles, and projectors.

Through the UrbanNest mobile app, residents can view availability, book instantly, pay seamlessly, and unlock devices with a tap. Each fixture is equipped with a smart lock system, ensuring only authorized users can access the appliance, and it automatically re-locks after use. This creates a frictionless, trustworthy experience with no dependency on third-party logistics.

Our solution is unique because it merges the convenience of subscription culture with the trust and proximity of community access. By embedding shared premium appliances within societies, we eliminate delivery hassles, reduce costs, and maximize usage efficiency.

Additionally, UrbanNest contributes to sustainability by promoting shared consumption, reducing electronic waste, and making high-end technology accessible without the burden of ownership.

In short, our unique solution is to transform luxury appliances into a shared, on-demand amenity within urban communities—convenient, affordable, and eco-friendly.","UrbanNest is selling to residential communities and their residents. Our primary customers are gated societies, apartment complexes, and co-living spaces, where we install IoT-enabled fixtures that provide shared access to premium appliances. This B2B2C model ensures that once a society is onboarded, every resident becomes a potential user.

The end-users are urban young professionals, students, and small families in the 20–40 age group. They are tech-savvy, convenience-driven, and financially conscious. These customers aspire to use high-end products like Dyson vacuums, PlayStations, or projectors but face two barriers—high upfront costs and limited living space. Even when they purchase such items, they remain underutilized.

Our unique insight is that this customer segment does not necessarily want to “own” appliances—they simply want easy, reliable access when needed. They are already comfortable with subscription and sharing models (Uber, Netflix, Airbnb) and see value in extending this mindset to household and entertainment devices.

By focusing on community-based access points, UrbanNest eliminates delivery hassles and creates a seamless, trust-based ecosystem inside their own society.

Our project was a text-to-video generation tool, built much before global companies like OpenAI brought such solutions into the spotlight.

As team lead, I guided both the technical development and the business strategy. We created a prototype that could generate short videos from text prompts, alongside a pitch deck that demonstrated its market potential and scalability.

The innovation and practicality of our idea earned us the first prize at the hackathon. We were also granted incubator access by CIIED, which gave us early exposure to the startup ecosystem and valuable mentorship.

This project was a defining early experience, helping me develop leadership, product-building, and pitching skills—capabilities I continue to apply in building UrbanNest.","One of our direct competitors in the U.S. is Tulu, but our deep understanding of the customer experience sets us apart. Unlike them, we prioritize app usability and transparency. In their app, pricing is hidden and only visible after multiple clicks, which frustrates users. At UrbanNest, we design our app to be clear, upfront, and frictionless, showing availability and pricing instantly.

Another gap is customer mobility. Tulu fixes the user to one building after sign-up, making it difficult when they move. UrbanNest allows flexible access across partner communities, recognizing that urban residents often change apartments and cities.

We also take a different approach to damages and accountability. Tulu absorbs all costs, which increases overhead and eventually impacts pricing. UrbanNest follows a shared-responsibility model, ensuring sustainability, fairness, and reduced misuse.

Most importantly, our insight is that this business is not just about providing appliances—it is about creating a trusted community amenity. By embedding smart, secure access inside societies and focusing on affordable convenience + sustainability, we make UrbanNest both scalable and aligned with the real lifestyle of urban residents.","1) By participating in Ignite, would we be able to get mentorship on how we can expand in 2 different countries - UAE and India at once?

Https://www.dhruvenbhalerao.com",Yes,8888774516,Others,Prototype,"India’s sewer and river systems are failing because waste is not stopped at its root. Most towns release untreated sewage directly into natural water bodies, as sewage treatment plants are too costly to install at scale, and even existing ones underperform. Current cleaning methods like suction machines or desilting excavators only maintain flow, leaving sludge, plastics, and biological waste inside sewers. Over time this causes blockages, flooding, and severe pollution of rivers and lakes. More than half the waste bypasses floating barriers and river nets, as it is non-floatable and sinks into layers, turning rivers into open sewers. Plastics break down into microplastics, now found in salt and sugar consumed daily. Manual scavenging, though banned, still continues because existing machines are inefficient and inaccessible to tier-3 cities, leading to over 600 deaths annually. Authorities end up spending on fragmented, temporary fixes instead of addressing the root cause. This results in polluted rivers, unsafe sanitation work, public health hazards, and wasted budgets. The core issue is that there is no system that intercepts, segregates, and treats waste directly in sewers before it enters water bodies, while also providing rapid, safe cleaning without risking human lives.","The current sewer infrastructure was never designed for the rapid urban growth of recent decades. Today, 70–80% of sewers are still cleaned through manual scavenging despite the ban, and most of the remaining are maintained with suction machines, robotic arms, or drones that only restore flow rather than remove waste. Untreated sewage and plastics continue to enter rivers, lakes, and seas, making natural water bodies extensions of man-made sewers. Skimmers and river barriers fail because more than half of the waste is non-floatable and sinks beneath the surface, forming layers that choke ecosystems. Installing sewage treatment plants across thousands of smaller towns is financially unfeasible, as a single plant can cost nine figures—higher than the annual budget of many municipalities. Even in larger cities, plants are unable to process the full volume of sewage, leaving huge quantities untreated. As a result, downstream cleaning projects repeatedly fail, while microplastics steadily infiltrate food chains. On the human side, sanitation workers are forced into unsafe, inhuman work environments, risking their lives daily. The underlying problem is systemic: we lack affordable, scalable solutions that intercept waste before it reaches natural water sources, while also eliminating the need for humans to enter hazardous sewers.","Our approach combines two integrated technologies that tackle the problem at its root. Chakravyuh is a modular chamber-like interception system installed directly on sewer lines before they merge into rivers or treatment plants. It traps 100% of solid waste, filters wastewater across multiple parameters, and ensures continuous flow even if compartments are full. It comes in two versions—one designed for sewers ending at STPs, and another for those discharging into natural water bodies. The design is scalable, cost-efficient, and prepared for IoT integration with sensors and cameras for real-time monitoring.
Abhimanyu is a robotic scavenger designed to clean the Chakravyuh units as well as existing manholes and nullahs. Mounted on a vehicle, it uses a hydraulic arm with conveyor systems to lift sludge and waste safely, separating heavy sludge and recyclables into different compartments. It eliminates the need for manual entry, speeds up cleaning, and can be adapted for multiple municipal functions, from unclogging drains to serving as a crane or fire-extinguishing arm.
Together, Chakravyuh and Abhimanyu replace fragmented, expensive equipment with a complete cycle: interception, segregation, and dignified cleaning. This not only reduces pollution and improves STP efficiency but also restores safety and dignity to sanitation workforces while delivering measurable environmental impact.","Our primary customers are municipal corporations, city councils, and state sanitation departments that are directly responsible for sewer networks, rivers, and waste management. These authorities struggle with limited budgets, rising pollution, and unsafe manual scavenging practices, yet need affordable, scalable systems that deliver visible and measurable results. For them, Chakravyuh provides interception and filtration before waste reaches water bodies, while Abhimanyu replaces multiple desilting machines with one multipurpose robotic arm capable of rapid, safe sewer cleaning. Both solutions align with government mandates for Swachh Bharat, pollution control, and manual scavenging eradication.
Secondary customers include industrial estates, institutional campuses, and private firms that operate their own STPs or ETPs but face high costs and inefficiencies. Chakravyuh Advanced can be integrated at the machine level to improve output, while Abhimanyu supports periodic maintenance. NGOs and international agencies working on environmental and public health projects are also potential partners for deployment, as our system directly addresses SDGs related to water, sanitation, and decent work.
Our unique insight is that customers no longer want fragmented tools; they want end-to-end solutions that reduce costs, remove risk, and provide auditable data for compliance. By offering a system that intercepts, processes, and reports, we fit this gap precisely.","₹0.30 lakhs (₹30,000) as of now.","₹5 lakh non-dilutive grant from AIC–IIITH Foundation (Not in bank yet).

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R8enos7JP0oyDNUVMzSMY1j_WqXM4kNU","Our team members have pioneered projects across sanitation and sustainable nutrition, both of which earned national recognition.
Rail Trolley 360 was developed to improve hygiene and waste management in Indian Railways. It integrates segregated bins, a bottle crusher, a plate roller crusher, sealed food compartments, and a QR/barcode system for passenger feedback. The project was awarded under the Viksit Bharat initiative and received a Letter of Intent and study approval from Bhusaval Railway Division (Central Railway, Govt. of India), monitored by zonal and district authorities.
In parallel, we created the world’s first millet-based soya chaap, a ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook product that can be stored in brine without preservatives. This innovation addresses sustainable protein needs and aligns with Zero Hunger goals. It was awarded at the Amrut National Competition on Millet Innovation by AICTE, affirming its impact and scalability.
These experiences reflect our strength in converting systemic challenges into scalable, validated solutions—whether in food security or waste management—while securing institutional backing and national recognition.","Most companies in sanitation and water management look at the problem in fragments—either river cleaning, sewer flow restoration, or treatment plants. We understand that unless waste is intercepted at its root, every downstream effort will fail, no matter how advanced the machinery. Our insight is that the real challenge is not only technical but systemic: fragmented equipment, high costs, and unsafe practices have created a cycle where pollution and manual scavenging persist together.
PREserwe was built on the belief that solving this needs a continuous, auditable system—from interception of waste, to dignified cleaning, to measurable reporting. That is why Chakravyuh is designed to trap and treat waste before it reaches rivers, and Abhimanyu is designed to eliminate manual entry by replacing multiple machines with one robotic system. We also recognise that municipalities and industries want outcomes, not just machines—clean drains, compliance-ready reports, and lower operational costs.
Unlike others, we combine root-cause interception, IoT-enabled monitoring, and worker dignity into one framework, aligning with both SDG goals and procurement realities of Indian towns. This holistic, systems-level view—treating water, waste, and human safety as inseparable—is what sets us apart and drives long-term adoption.","We are not just building a startup — we are building a movement grounded in five pillars: Observe, Change, Innovate, Policy, and Philosophy. PREserwe was born from observing the realities of pollution and manual scavenging, translating those insights into innovation, and aligning them with both community needs and national policy. Our philosophy is that solutions must address root causes, not symptoms.
This vision has already been recognised — from representing India at global forums to being ranked and awarded by AICTE, GSEA, Dyson, and other prestigious institutions. Even in my academic journey, from US admissions to being featured in AICTE’s “Inspiring Story,” the consistent theme has been to turn ideas into impact with credibility and scale.
Our long-term goal is to evolve PREserwe into a PSU-level entity, because India’s water and sanitation crisis demands national infrastructure solutions, not isolated pilots. Right now, we are focused on execution with ready consumers, but we see this as a foundation for building the world’s first systemic sanitation model out of India.
So our only question to IGNITE is: How can your platform support ventures like ours, which are not chasing investment alone, but striving to transform into national-scale public infrastructure providers?"

Practice Mode with Instant Feedback – Candidates attempt coding, system design, or behavioral questions and receive real-time, audio-based feedback. They can immediately refine their answers and practice iteratively, making the learning process fast and interactive. Unlike text-based tools, our system engages through voice, creating a true interview-like experience.

Assessment Mode with Detailed Analysis – Once prepared, candidates enter a full-length mock interview where the AI acts as an interviewer without interruption. At the end, candidates receive comprehensive feedback not only on technical accuracy but also on soft skills like communication, tone, clarity, and confidence—an area ignored by most existing platforms.

This dual approach uniquely balances practice and testing, ensuring candidates can learn, improve, and then validate their readiness.

Secondly, fertilizer use is considered non-optimal (e.g., not following soil health), which farmers are unaware of. Thirdly, they depend on monsoons for 50% of all rainfall in India. Fourthly, farmers do not plan their crops based on market demand. Because of these issues, average yields are 30-50% below the global average, with farmers spending 35-40% of their income on inputs, and netting around ₹ 10,000-12,000/month.

We start, unlike agricultural extension services or input marketplaces, with the root problem of soil health. We provide a low-cost pathway to testing at ₹70 to 100 per test vs. > 500 paid in labs, allowing us to scale to over 150 million smallholder farmers. We make it possible to create a proprietary soil health database that enables predictive models for yield, price and pest risk in the range of 80 to 85 percent accuracy.

Our Krishi Mitra advisory engine uses this database to help farmers operationalise this into what to grow, when to grow it, how to enrich the soil, and where to go to sell. Pilot results already show 20 to 25 percent yield improvements, 15 to 20 percent higher farm gate prices and 10 to 12 percent higher harvest realisation. By integrating low cost farmer onboarding with scalable technology, and market-aware advice, Krishi Mantra can unlock fifty billion dollars of agricultural value while enabling sustainable transformation in farmer economics.","The primary customer for our offerings are India's 146 million farmers; 80 percent+ of which are small and marginal farmers, who farm less than two hectares. Small and marginal farmers contribute a significant share of the national food production and ultimately GDP, but are mostly underserved in technology, credit and advisory. The average small and marginal farmer takes home ₹10,000 to 12,000 per month, approximately 40% goes to purchasing seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. They are highly price-sensitive and reluctant to try digital solutions; but thanks partly to the rapid adoption of smart phones in recent years, 500 million rural users have moved online. 

The distinctive insight of this customer segment is that they are dual constrained by scarcity of resources and uncertainty of decision making. Farmers want to reduce costs, and improve yields.

Successfully led a $20 million fundraising initiative for Cinnamon Wealth by driving efforts to facilitate a strategic merger with Punjab Sindh Bank.","Krishi Mantra is different. We've learned from experience that the way to a prosperous farming community is built on the foundation of soil. Most competitors are merely interested in the logistics of input distribution, the efficiencies of the supply chain, or the convenience of output marketplaces. They forget that the upstream issue from which all agriculture starts means paying attention to soil health. Without precision soil intelligence, advisory consultations and marketplace activity are useless, reactive and incomplete. By using affordable hyperlocal soil testing as the model we are (unlike any player in market at scale) creating a living database of soil health profiles across geographies.
The soil-first model makes integration of an AI-driven predictive intelligence layer on yields, pest risks, and market price, with 80–85 percent accuracy combined, possible. This allows farmers to plan instead of react. We have identified that although marketplaces do offer transformation to agriculture, it's not from a marketplace, it's empowering farmers with ownership of data and actionable insights. Our competitors sell inputs; we sell knowledge, plus a better chance at profitability.","Does our problem statement and solution come across as clear, urgent, and differentiated?

Do you believe our soil-first USP is strong enough to stand apart from other agri-tech players?

Are the market size and customer insights convincing and well-supported with data?

Do the metrics and pilot results (yield uplift, pricing gains, farmer adoption) feel credible and investment-ready?

Unlike isolated analytics dashboards, our framework bridges the gap between studios and players, ensuring that every release is data-driven, human-verified, and player-first.

Key differentiators:

Human-in-the-loop AI: Ensures accuracy, context, and avoids the “black box” problem which is why 95% of AI tools fail.

Layered cognition: Our proprietary Semantic Sentinel, PersonaSim, and InsightLoop modules de-noise feedback, simulate player behavior, and translate insights into spec-ready tickets.

Tri-metric scoring: Every decision is rated for UX impact, PR safety, and financial ROI, keeping leadership aligned.

Holistic methodology: Instead of being a single plugin, our system improves backlog refinement, live-ops cadence, monetization tuning, and community trust — all at once.

Validated by Heather Chandler (Helldivers 2 producer), this framework reduces iteration waste, saves millions in development cost, and helps studios build games that both players love and publishers profit from.","Our customers are game studios worldwide primarily mid-tier/AA studios and ambitious indies, with future expansion into AAA publishers.

Deliver faster without ballooning QA costs.

Improve player retention and monetization ethically.

Avoid PR disasters caused by unpopular updates.

Industry insight:

Global gaming market: $250B+ TAM with rising live-service models.

AI penetration in product management is near zero, meaning almost no competition.

Studios currently rely on intuition or fragmented analytics tools that fail to explain why players churn.

We start with low-risk, high-value pilots: a 6–8 week Backlog Refinement Sprint or Community QA Decode. This proves ROI by showing reduced rework and improved patch reception. Once trust is established, we expand into full design iteration and live-ops co-piloting.

Adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period. According to the World Health Organization, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15–19-year-olds globally. These alarming statistics reflect a growing mental health crisis that often stems from unaddressed emotional struggles.

Through EI coaching, children learn to recognize and articulate their emotions, cope with stress in healthy ways, and build confidence. Over time, these skills contribute to greater academic performance, stronger relationships, and a reduced risk of mental health issues. In the long run, emotionally intelligent individuals are better equipped to navigate life’s ups and downs without feeling overwhelmed or defeated. Empowering kids with EI is not just preventive care—it’s an investment in a future generation that is self-aware, resilient, and emotionally strong.","Emotional intelligence (EI) coaching offers transformative benefits across all stages of life, from childhood through adulthood. For kids, EI coaching builds the foundation for self-awareness, emotional regulation, and empathy. These skills are essential for managing peer relationships, coping with academic pressures, and developing resilience. As they grow, emotionally intelligent children become better problem-solvers, effective communicators, and more adaptable to change.

In adolescence and young adulthood, EI coaching becomes a powerful tool for navigating identity, relationships, and increased responsibilities. It helps individuals make thoughtful decisions, manage stress, and avoid impulsive behavior. It also plays a critical role in mental health, reducing the risk of anxiety, depression, and burnout.

For adults, EI enhances leadership, workplace collaboration, and personal relationships. It fosters better conflict resolution, greater emotional stability, and improved decision-making under pressure. In professional environments, emotionally intelligent individuals are often more successful, as they inspire trust, manage teams effectively, and handle feedback constructively.

Across all ages, EI coaching nurtures emotional resilience, empowering individuals to face life’s challenges with confidence and composure. Whether in school, work, or relationships, the ability to understand and manage emotions is a lifelong asset that directly contributes to personal well-being, success, and fulfillment.","Emotional intelligence (EI) training for kids is increasingly essential in today's complex and fast-paced world. Children are exposed to various emotional and social challenges from a young age, and without the tools to navigate these experiences, they can struggle with stress, anxiety, and conflict. EI training helps children recognize, understand, and manage their emotions, while also teaching empathy, communication, and healthy social interaction.

The necessity of EI lies in its long-term impact. Children with strong emotional intelligence are better equipped to handle peer pressure, resolve conflicts peacefully, and make responsible decisions. These skills directly influence academic performance, mental well-being, and the ability to form strong, supportive relationships. As they grow, emotionally intelligent children become more resilient adults, capable of coping with life’s setbacks and adapting to change.

Insights from EI training reveal that when children learn to express emotions constructively, they build self-confidence and reduce behavioral issues. They also become more aware of others’ feelings, fostering compassion and teamwork. In a world where emotional challenges are a leading cause of adolescent distress, equipping kids with emotional intelligence is not just beneficial—it is crucial for their overall development, mental health, and future success in both personal and professional spheres.",0,NA,NA,12000000000,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UkDC80QyubbSlwLCKhC0CPg_yCG6U_Hu/view?usp=drive_link,Yes,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UkDC80QyubbSlwLCKhC0CPg_yCG6U_Hu/view?usp=drive_link,My Team and I as a Team Lead were selected in a National top team for the theme Sustainability and mobility in 2030. We proposed a solution on how to use fuel using nature and inject it into electric cars so there is complete anti-pollution era in the near future.,"What sets our Emotional Intelligence (EI) coaching business apart is a strategic and research-driven understanding of EI as a critical component of long-term personal and professional success—not merely a behavioral tool. While many companies approach EI as a supplementary or “soft skill” program, we treat it as a core developmental framework rooted in psychology, neuroscience, and educational best practices.

We understand that emotional intelligence is not a one-time lesson or a generic curriculum—it’s a dynamic process that must be personalized, measurable, and embedded into everyday experiences. Our coaching model is structured to align with key developmental milestones, ensuring age-appropriate skill-building that evolves with the child. This developmental insight is often overlooked by others who offer uniform programs across age groups.

Professionally, we prioritize sustainability and real-world application. We don’t just teach emotional vocabulary or coping mechanisms—we train children to apply EI in decision-making, problem-solving, leadership, and interpersonal interactions. We also emphasize collaboration with parents and educators to reinforce skills across home and school environments.

Most importantly, we treat emotional intelligence as a foundational investment in a child's future—enhancing not only academic and social success but also leadership potential and lifelong mental health. This long-term, integrated vision sets our approach apart in both philosophy and practice.",NA

This will help owners optimize space utilization, attract more customers, and standardize operations. By bridging this gap, we are not just solving a daily inconvenience but also contributing to smoother urban mobility and a smarter, more efficient parking ecosystem.","Our startup introduces a tech-enabled solution to address the persistent issue of urban parking inefficiency. Through our mobile application, users can discover and pre-book available parking spaces in real-time, ensuring hassle-free and time-saving parking experiences.

Our insight is that SMEs don’t just need a system to record transactions—they need a lightweight, AI-driven platform that integrates seamlessly with their existing workflows, is easy to adopt, and provides actionable insights rather than raw data. Unlike traditional ERP vendors, we recognize that affordability, localization, and plug-and-play usability matter far more than enterprise-grade customization for this segment. By addressing these pain points with modular design, language support, and AI-powered automation, we bridge the gap between big ERP functionality and SME realities.",What’s one piece of advice you would give to teams like ours for building a successful product?

While LED streetlights are widely adopted for their lower energy consumption compared to conventional lighting, they still waste a significant portion of input energy as heat. Research indicates that nearly 60% of the electricity consumed by LEDs is dissipated as heat, which not only reduces the overall efficiency of the lighting system but also shortens the lifespan of the LEDs, increasing maintenance costs for municipalities and industries. Additionally, India spends thousands of crores annually on electricity for public street lighting, contributing to both high operational costs and increased carbon emissions.

Currently, this wasted heat has no productive use and is merely a byproduct, representing untapped potential in energy conservation. At a time when climate change and carbon reduction are critical global priorities, ignoring such energy loss poses both an economic and environmental problem. The lack of integrated renewable energy recovery mechanisms in public lighting infrastructure further worsens the issue. Our project directly addresses this gap by converting the wasted heat into usable electricity, reducing costs, improving efficiency, and contributing to sustainability goals like SDG 7 (Affordable Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).","The problem we are solving lies in the inefficiency and energy wastage in the current street lighting systems.

Our project directly addresses this gap by converting the wasted heat into usable electricity, reducing costs, improving efficiency, and contributing to sustainability goals like SDG 7 (Affordable Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).","Our unique solution is to transform LED streetlights into dual-purpose systems that not only provide lighting but also generate additional electricity from the heat they naturally emit. We achieve this by integrating Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) modules, which harness the Seebeck effect to capture waste heat from LEDs and convert it into usable electrical energy. This recovered energy can be fed back to support the same lighting system or stored in small battery units for powering sensors, IoT devices, or backup lighting, thereby reducing overall power consumption.

Unlike existing LED systems that merely focus on reducing energy demand, our innovation ensures that a portion of the input energy—otherwise wasted as heat—is recycled, improving energy efficiency by nearly 20%. This directly translates into reduced electricity bills for municipalities and industries, extended LED lifespan due to controlled heat dissipation, and a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.

What sets our solution apart is its cost-effectiveness and scalability. With minimal modification to existing infrastructure, our technology can be deployed across millions of streetlights in India, creating massive cumulative savings. By converting wasted heat into renewable electricity, our innovation addresses both economic and environmental challenges while positioning itself as a sustainable smart-lighting solution for the future.","We are primarily selling to municipal corporations, smart city projects, and government bodies responsible for public street lighting, as they manage large-scale lighting infrastructure. Additionally, our target customers include private townships, industrial parks, educational campuses, and commercial complexes that rely on extensive outdoor lighting. These customers face high recurring electricity costs and demand energy-efficient solutions. Our product not only lowers their operational expenses but also aligns with sustainability goals.

Unlike current options, which are largely of Russian or Western origin, our system is entirely developed in India, ensuring self-reliance and cost-effectiveness.

The munition is engineered for seamless integration with C4I infrastructures such as IACCS, Trigun, and Agni Teer, allowing it to operate within the existing national air defence network. This interoperability ensures faster deployment and coordinated responses across multiple platforms.

A key differentiator is its compact onboard radar module, which provides target detection and displays information directly to the operator. This enables precise tracking and engagement without dependence on external radar assets, making the system more flexible and easier to deploy in diverse operational scenarios.

By combining indigenous design, interoperability, and simplified operator use, our solution provides a scalable, affordable, and mission-ready counter-UAV capability tailored to Indian defence needs, while reducing reliance on foreign technologies.","Indian Armed Forces

One of my past projects was SCIoT (Smart Centralized IoT System), a holistic framework that merged centralized control with IoT networks to create an integrated, adaptive environment. Instead of treating devices as isolated endpoints, SCIoT applied systems theory and cybernetics principles, ensuring feedback loops, self-regulation, and interoperability across diverse white-labeled hardware. Using rule-based operations combined with AI integration, the system not only facilitated seamless device orchestration but also enabled intelligent energy optimization as a secondary benefit, reducing power consumption while maintaining efficiency.

Finalist (Top 12) – IIM Bombay (Startup Competition)","We understand that India’s defence requirements cannot be met by simply adapting Western or Russian technologies. Most existing systems are designed for different geographies, doctrines, and threat perceptions. Our approach is built on recognizing India-specific operational challenges, such as high UAV activity along contested borders, difficult terrain, and the need for cost-effective, easily deployable solutions.

Unlike foreign-origin systems that often demand heavy infrastructure, training, or import dependency, we focus on indigenous, modular, and operator-friendly design. For example, our munition’s integrated radar and targeting display reduces reliance on external assets, ensuring flexibility in mobile and forward deployments—an aspect often overlooked by global players.

We also recognize that seamless integration with India’s C4I systems (IACCS, Trigun, Agni Teer) is critical. Foreign solutions often face compatibility issues or require expensive customization, while our system is built from the ground up for interoperability within the Indian defence network.

Most importantly, we understand the urgency of self-reliance in critical defence technologies. Where others see a market for imports, we see an opportunity to build scalable, indigenous capabilities that strengthen national security and reduce long-term dependency.","yeah.

Their groundbreaking scripts and manuscripts gather digital dust, locked out by the impenetrable walls of the entertainment and publishing industries. Lacking the right connections, they are denied access to producers and publishers, left with no secure way to share their intellectual property, and shut off from the critical funding. Simultaneously, producers, studio executives, and publishers are drowning in a sea of submissions.

We are doing so by providing a platform to everyone in these industries. Sparqble is a first-of-its-kind platform that forges a revolutionary ecosystem, uniting a Secure Script Marketplace with powerful Community-Driven Crowdfunding. For the first time, writers can showcase, sell, and unleash their scripts without fear of theft, while producers gain access to a curated pipeline of original stories. Visionary filmmakers no longer need to rely solely on traditional funding, they can ignite their projects by raising capital directly from a passionate community of backers. By connecting writers, creators, and their audience in one transparent and trusted hub, Sparqble shatters the old barriers that keep fresh ideas from reaching the screen.","Our platform sells to two interconnected groups: 
1. Creators seeking opportunities 
2. Backers providing support (cinephiles or investors) 
3. Producers and Publishers 
Creators: We empower indie filmmakers, such as young directors, short film makers, animated creators, and regional storytellers from small towns or language niches, often hindered by mainstream gatekeepers like Bollywood or OTT. They can use Sparqble for secure script sharing, funding, and creative freedom. Digital creators, including YouTubers and Instagrammers, convert fan bases into co-producers. Emerging talent like film students and writers with scripts but no budgets find a launchpad. Additionally, producers, directors, production houses, actors, and service providers leverage our ""Discover"" marketplace to pitch, list services, scout talent, collaborate, and network in a trusted social-media-like hub. 

Backers: We attract young cinephiles (urban Gen Z and millennials craving fresh OTT narratives), loyal creator fans supporting favorites, socially conscious viewers funding overlooked causes, NRIs/diaspora backing authentic cultural cinema, and xenophiles investing in international storytelling. They receive rewards, early access, and profit shares, fostering community ownership.

The project features a Flask-based backend API with four core ML models: a CNN for hotspot detection in solar panel images, a Random Forest for dust analysis, predictive maintenance forecasting, and efficiency optimization. The frontend provides a web interface for monitoring and analysis. The system includes extensive training data (over 1,600 images for dust detection and 1,000 images for hotspot detection) and offers RESTful API endpoints for real-time monitoring, historical data analysis, and automated alerts.

Traditionally, shoes have allowed the wearer to choose between good looks and comfort. With Versole the wearer has no choice. The adjustable device is simple, unique and effective. The solution is built right in to the shoe and is as much a part of the shoe as the sole is. The adjustable device allows the wearer to switch instantly between a four inch height, and a two inch height, just like that!  No other shoes, no inserts, and no hassle.

Additionally, there’s a growing need for discreet, functional features that enhance daily convenience—such as a quick way to capture voice notes or send emergency alerts without unnecessary complexity.

This isn't just broken healthcare - it's breaking hearts and families every single day.
We're here to fix this.","We're building Ayu Sangrah Bharat (ASB), India's first AI powered system that makes existing health records actually usable - transforming scattered ABHA data into organized insights for doctors, patients, and hospitals.
Look, ABHA already exists. The government created this digital health ID system where every Indian can get a unique identifier to store and access medical records digitally. But here's the brutal truth - it's completely failing in real life. The user experience is terrible, it barely integrates with hospital systems, and adoption is extremely poor. Patients still show up with folders full of reports, doctors still waste time skimming through messy documents trying to understand patient histories.
What we've built is an intelligent layer on top of ABHA that transforms years of chaotic medical data into clear insights doctors can actually use. Think of it like having a tool that automatically spots missed treatments, predicts health risks from patient history, and ensures nothing critical gets overlooked. The doctor remains in full control, but now they have the information they need instantly.
For patients, sharing health data becomes as simple as approving a UPI payment. You decide exactly who sees what parts of your medical history, with complete transparency at every step.
For hospitals, integration is painless. Our APIs work with whatever systems they're already using, so no major overhauls needed.
Essentially, ASB is to health data what UPI is to payments. We're not replacing anything. We're just making the existing system finally work the way it was supposed to from day one.","Our primary customers are healthcare providers across India - hospitals, clinics, and individual doctors who are overwhelmed by unstructured patient data and tiring administrative work.
Primary Target: Doctors and Healthcare Institutions
Here's what we figured out that everyone else missed: doctors don't want more data thrown at them. They want relevant, actionable insights. Current systems just dump raw files on doctors, forcing them to waste 40% of their time on paperwork instead of actually treating patients.
Through many conversations with practicing physicians, we discovered something crucial - doctors will only adopt new technology if it immediately saves them time. The moment you add even one extra step to their workflow, you've lost them.
Secondary Target: Patients
Let's be realistic about India's digital divide. Urban millennials and Gen Z are comfortable with apps, but we have millions of rural users and older generations who aren't. That's our biggest challenge and opportunity.
Our approach is to make the patient experience so simple and beneficial that even hesitant users will adopt it. Yes, they'll need to create accounts and use basic app functions, but we're designing for the lowest common denominator - simple interfaces, vernacular language support, and clear immediate benefits like never losing medical files again.
The Key Insight: Our ""UPI Moment""
UPI succeeded because it solved payment friction for both merchants and customers simultaneously, and eventually even reluctant users adopted it because the benefits were undeniable. Healthcare digitization needs to work the same way.
Market Timing
Post-COVID, even traditionally resistant users are more open to digital healthcare solutions.

https://shrage.vercel.app/","1. The Doctor-First Approach Most healthtech companies build for patients first, then wonder why doctors don't adopt their solutions. We realized that in India's healthcare system, doctors are the real gatekeepers. If you don't solve their immediate pain points, nothing else matters. Patients will go wherever their trusted doctor tells them to go.
2. ABHA's Real Problem Isn't Technical Everyone thinks ABHA failed because of bad technology. That's not true. ABHA failed because it focused on data storage instead of data utility. Doctors don't need another place to store files - they need those files to actually help them make better decisions faster.
3. Trust Before Technology Indians trust relationships, not apps. Patients will share health data only if their doctor recommends the platform. This isn't about privacy policies or encryption - it's about doctor endorsement driving adoption.
4. Scale Through Simplicity Most companies try to build comprehensive solutions that do everything. We focus on doing one thing exceptionally well - making scattered medical data instantly useful for doctors. Everything else builds from there.","We're at a critical stage where we need strategic partnerships to validate and scale ASB effectively. Here are the key areas where we'd really value your support:
1. ABHA Sandbox Access We need access to ABHA's sandbox environment to properly integrate and test our intelligent layer. This is essential for building the seamless experience we're promising. Can you help us navigate the process or connect us with the right people at ABHA?
2. Pilot Hospital Partnerships We're looking for forward-thinking hospitals and clinics willing to pilot ASB - ideally a mix of different sizes and types (corporate hospitals, mid-size clinics, diagnostic centers). Do you have relationships with healthcare institutions that might be interested in being early adopters?
3. Government Connections Getting connected with the ABHA team and relevant people at the Health Ministry would be incredibly valuable. We want to ensure ASB complements the government's digital health vision rather than working against it. Any introductions or guidance on the right approach would be hugely helpful.
4. Your Take on Market Readiness Based on your experience, do you think the Indian healthcare ecosystem is actually ready for this kind of solution right now? What obstacles do you foresee that we might not be considering?
We're not just looking for funding - we need partners who understand this space and can help us navigate the complexities of healthcare digitization in India."

# Lack of Financial Education: Schools rarely offer core money skills such as budgeting, saving, investing, taxes, credit management, or insurance.
# Difficulty Engaging Youth: Traditional financial education is often boring, abstract, and hard to relate. Especially for digital-native teens and young adults.
# Missed Early Opportunities: Without hands-on learning, young people miss critical chances to form lifelong habits, start investing early, and avoid common financial mistakes.
#Indian Context Gap: Many resources ignore India-specific realities, like UPI, tax rules, family allowances, local banking, and regional financial behaviors.","# Lack of Financial Education: Schools rarely offer core money skills such as budgeting, saving, investing, taxes, credit management, or insurance.

Whether it’s deciding which restaurant to try, which movie to watch, what music to play, or how to spend an evening with friends, the endless options often lead to decision fatigue. This problem is amplified in urban lifestyles, where time is limited, attention spans are short, and personal preferences are diverse and dynamic.

Traditional recommendation engines—like those on streaming platforms or review sites—work in isolation and lack true personalization. They recommend based on popularity, ratings, or past activity, but fail to understand the individual’s mood, context, or social setting at that very moment. For example, choosing a café when you’re working alone requires a different recommendation than when you’re with friends celebrating.

Unlike traditional platforms that focus only on one vertical (e.g., food apps, movie apps, or music apps), LifeDJ unifies them into a single intelligent system.

The uniqueness lies in its DJ-style orchestration of experiences—instead of simply listing options, it curates a flow of suggestions that fit your current mood, time, and social context. For example, if you’re feeling “relaxed” on a Friday evening, it might suggest a cozy restaurant, pair it with a calming movie, and add a soft playlist to complete the vibe. This goes beyond basic recommendations and creates end-to-end lifestyle journeys.

Technically, the system integrates real-time web data (latest movies, trending restaurants, reviews) with user modeling and AI-driven sentiment/context understanding, ensuring suggestions are always fresh, relevant, and deeply personal. The multi-backend LLM design (OpenAI, Ollama, local Transformers) ensures adaptability and cost-efficiency, while hybrid recommendation algorithms combine popularity, similarity, and personalization for maximum accuracy.","LifeDJ AI is designed for urban millennials and Gen Z professionals who struggle with decision fatigue in their fast-paced lives. These users often juggle work, social commitments, and self-care, leaving little mental bandwidth to decide “What should I do today?” or “Where should I go tonight?”. They are tech-savvy, rely heavily on apps for food, movies, and events, but currently face the pain of switching between multiple platforms to piece together a complete plan for their day or evening.

Our unique insight is that people don’t just want isolated suggestions (like only a movie or only a restaurant). Instead, they crave context-driven experiences—a flow of activities that match their mood, time, and company. For example, someone feeling “energetic” on a Saturday afternoon doesn’t just want to know the top movie; they want a complete vibe: a fun activity, a trending café, and music that matches the moment.

LifeDJ taps into this unmet need by being a one-stop lifestyle DJ, curating experiences rather than disjointed options.

Most apps today are built vertically — a food delivery app shows restaurants, a movie app shows listings, a travel app shows places. But in reality, human decisions are emotional, contextual, and interconnected.

For example, when someone feels “romantic,” they don’t just want a restaurant suggestion. They want the whole flow: a cozy movie, a dinner spot, maybe even a playlist that enhances the mood. Other platforms treat these choices as separate problems; LifeDJ uniquely treats them as one decision journey, orchestrated like a DJ curates music.

We also recognize that mood, time, and social context (alone, with friends, with a partner) are the real drivers of decisions, not just ratings or discounts. That’s why our AI blends sentiment analysis, live internet signals, and user modeling to suggest “what fits now” rather than just “what’s popular.”

For doctors, the device is equally inefficient—offering limited visibility, cumbersome handling, and poor alignment with current clinical workflows. This outdated tool sustains barriers to screening and drives one of Asia’s highest cervical cancer mortality rates.","The Nia Speculum’s four-petaled modular design ensures uniform pressure distribution, minimizing pain. A screw-based dilator with calibrated markings enables precise expansion, validated by testing. An embedded CMOS camera and LED provide clear imaging, while ergonomic self-insertion enhances comfort. Scalable injection-molded components and compliant electronics ensure safety, affordability, and widespread clinical adoption.

Nia Speculum’s two-part system couples a disposable, four-petal blade unit with a reusable dilator housing and electronics. Doctors choose one of three clear polypropylene petal sizes (8 cm, 11 cm, 14 cm) to match individual anatomy, with the provision of self-insertion, thereby negating the need for scooting at the end of the bed. After insertion—optionally self‑guided via an ergonomic handle—the clinician slowly rotates the central screw, uniformly expanding each petal to the desired opening with control. Embedded within the screw is a miniature CMOS camera and LED array (≥480p, 1,500 lux), transmitting live video to a smartphone or tablet for real‑time visualization, assisted with ML for cancer detection. Post‑exam, the blade unit is discarded or recycled, and the autoclavable dilator is sterilized for reuse. This design eliminates sudden force, reduces cold discomfort and vulnerability, upholds dignity, and improves diagnostic accuracy and procedural efficiency.","Our primary consumers are women aged 25–60 who undergo cervical screening, while our paying customers are healthcare providers—hospitals, diagnostic labs, NGOs, private clinics, and government health programs. In India, over 69,000 hospitals and 300,000 primary health centers routinely conduct gynecological exams, forming a large and underserved market. Globally, low- and middle-income countries face similar challenges in women’s health infrastructure.

The Nia Speculum offers a transformative value proposition. Unlike conventional metallic speculums, which cause significant discomfort and anxiety, Nia is a modular, self-insertable device made from biocompatible, sterilizable materials. Its user-friendly design improves patient comfort, reduces exam-related stress, and enhances acceptability, especially in low-resource and high-sensitivity contexts. For healthcare providers, Nia minimizes setup time, reduces sterilization costs, and improves procedural efficiency—potentially increasing patient throughput by 20–30%.

Our solution also aligns with public health goals, especially in India, where cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women. Early and regular screening can reduce mortality, but uptake remains below 30% nationally. By increasing comfort and accessibility, Nia can drive higher screening rates, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

The project began when Sonal conceptualized and developed an early prototype, which won the BETIC MEDHA Hackathon 2024 by IIT Bombay for its strong potential to transform vascular health screening in India. Soon after, Shantanab Das joined the effort, bringing expertise in interaction design and technology development. Together, the duo advanced the project further deep diving into research, testing sensor technologies and building novel design and functional prototypes, winning the C-IDEA Design Award 2025, an international recognition for innovation in design.

SARV has since been selected for the T-Hub Blitz cohort, giving the team access to entrepreneurial ecosystems, mentorship, and support networks to refine their product development. The project has also been shaped by guidance from 20+ experienced clinicians and industry experts, including Dr. Radhakrishnan Sagi, CEO of Konnect Diagnostics and Senior Orthopedic Surgeon at Renova Hospitals, Hyderabad, alongside several other practicing doctors across cardiology and vascular surgery. With SARV, the team aims to reduce barriers to early PAD screening in primary care and resource-limited settings, potentially impacting millions at risk of vascular disease worldwide.","At Arovya Labs, we recognize nuances in women’s healthcare that many companies overlook. The first is patient centricity. Tools used in highly vulnerable and sensitive procedures cannot be designed with only clinical efficiency in mind. We understand that patient experience—the fear, anxiety, and discomfort during gynecological procedures—is not a secondary concern but a decisive factor in whether women return for screenings or avoid them altogether. A truly equitable solution must balance the needs of practitioners with the comfort and agency of patients, without compromise.

Second, we deeply understand the efficiency of devices as a cornerstone of both affordability and adoption. When procedures are shorter and simpler, they save time for patients, reduce workload for doctors, and increase throughput for hospitals. Efficiency directly translates to accessibility, particularly in high-volume, resource-constrained healthcare systems like India.

Third, we are attuned to the post-COVID paradigm shift in healthcare. The world has moved away from “one-size-fits-all” and purely reusable solutions toward personalized, modular, and contamination-conscious devices. Sanitation, disposability, and infection control are no longer optional—they are expected. Our approach incorporates this understanding into the very architecture of our product.

Finally, we see that iterating over dated tools is not enough. Many companies simply add incremental features to instruments designed decades ago.

Holistic methodology: Instead of being a single plugin, our system improves backlog refinement, live-ops cadence, monetization tuning, and community trust — all at once.

Validated by Heather Chandler (Helldivers 2 producer), this framework reduces iteration waste, saves millions in development cost, and helps studios build games that both players love and publishers profit from.","Our customers are game studios worldwide — primarily mid-tier/AA studios and ambitious indies, with future expansion into AAA publishers.

Industry insight:

Global gaming market: $250B+ TAM with rising live-service models.

Your unique solution is creating isolated cloud-based virtual machines where AI coding assistants can operate with full permissions without any risk to production systems. Instead of trying to restrict AI permissions (which limits functionality) or scanning code statically (which misses runtime vulnerabilities), you let the AI run wild in a completely sandboxed cloud environment using Firecracker microVMs. When an AI tool like Cursor or Claude Code wants to execute code, it runs in your isolated cloud environment rather than on the user's local machine—the AI gets all the permissions it wants to delete files, access databases, and make network calls, but it's all happening in a throwaway virtual environment that gets destroyed after analysis. 

The breakthrough is that you're the only solution doing execution-based vulnerability detection: while competitors like Snyk just read code and guess what it might do, you actually run the AI-generated code in isolation and observe its behavior in real-time. This catches runtime vulnerabilities, logic bombs, and malicious patterns that are completely invisible to static analysis, delivering zero false positives because you see what code actually does rather than what it appears to do. You're essentially creating a ""padded room"" where AI can be as destructive as it wants while you safely study its behavior, then automatically remediate issues while preserving functionality giving developers the full power of AI coding without the catastrophic risks.","Target Customers: Enterprise Development Teams and Security-Conscious Organizations
