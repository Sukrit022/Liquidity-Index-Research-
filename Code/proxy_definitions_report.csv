It measures intraday price uncertainty/volatility, not transaction costs.                  True spread estimators (like Corwin-Schultz 2012) use 2-day high/low ratios:             β = Σ[log(H_t/L_t)^2] over 2 days             α = (√(2β) - √β) / (3 - 2√2) - √(β / (3 - 2√2))             spread = 2*(e^α - 1) / (1 + e^α)                  We use simplified normalized range: 2*(H-L)/(H+L)         This captures price volatility/information flow, not bid-ask spreads.
